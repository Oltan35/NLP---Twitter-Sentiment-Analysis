# NLP---Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

This project about sentiment analysis regarding the entered tweets by twitter users. As you see the dataset, I made it possible for the machine to understand how people felt about any subject and did an analysis of how angry or happy they were with machine learning algorithms. I continued step by step. I before made an analysis related to null or noisy data and after needles thing. When the data was prepared to put a machine learning algorithm, finally achieved a high accuracy rate.
